This was made for a Raspberry Pi 5 that I host my local MongoDB server on.
I really loved using Atlas/MongoDB cloud but was annoyed by the speed, so I made this to replicate the experience.
Feel free to modify it however you want. 
I connect to the mongoDB server and this website on my main computer.

Side note:
   Since this is for a Pi 5, I'm running community edition. It shouldn't change any functionality, though.
